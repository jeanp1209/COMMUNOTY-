# GitHub Desktop Metrics
Desktop is a free, open source product that is maintained and worked on by the small, distributed team of @desktop/core, @desktop/comrades, and the general open-source community. As a result, we do not have the resources to do continuous, detailed user studies of GitHub Desktop users and usage. In other words, we love you, we want to build the right features to help you, and yet we don't know enough about you as a whole to make informed prioritization decisions.

We measure certain events in the GitHub Desktop app in order to learn more about how you are using the app. This helps us prioritize features and bugs and understand what things are most important to the largest number of people. Our understanding of these metrics is supplemented by some user research, usability testing, and feedback from the community. This document is intended to provide information about each thing we're measuring and what we're using it for.

You can always see our recently released user-facing features and fixes in the [release notes](https://desktop.github.com/release-notes/) of our marketing page, and example usage data [here](https://desktop.github.com/usage-data/).

## Dimensions
These are general metrics about users that are aggregated to understand general user behavior and to help us segment usage patterns. These helps us prioritize work, predict technical and performance implications of our features, and plan for devOps needs.

| Metric | Description | Justification |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `version` | The version of Desktop. | To visualize update rates and performance metrics for each version of Desktop, so we can track whether users are staying up-to-date and which older versions are active. |
| `osVersion` | The OS version. | To identify the most common versions of operating systems people use Desktop on, so we can more accurately prioritize version-specific bugs. |
| `platform` | The OS. | To understand which platforms are most popular among people who use Desktop, so we can more accurately prioritize platform-specific bugs.  |
| `repositoryCount` | The total number of tracked repositories in Desktop. | To understand the typical number of repositories tracked in Desktop, so we can make appropriate decisions in terms of performance and UI. |
| `gitHubRepositoryCount` | The number of GitHub repositories. | To understand the typical number of repositories tracked in Desktop that are hosted on GitHub, so we can more accurately prioritize GitHub workflows in Desktop. |
| `guid` | The unique ID of a Desktop installation. | This allows us to aggregate metrics across multiple days, so we can understand how many people use Desktop per week or per month, and how many people use a particular feature per month.  |
| `dotComAccount` | Flag that is set if the user is logged in with a GitHub.com account | Informs us on the percentage of people who use Desktop with GitHub.com, so we can more accurately prioritize GitHub workflows in Desktop. |
| `enterpriseAccount` | Flag that is set if the user is logged in with a GitHub Enterprise account. | Informs us on the percentage of people who use Desktop with an Enterprise instance of GitHub, so we can more accurately prioritize Enterprise-related bugs. |
| `theme` | The name of the currently selected theme/application appearance as set at time of stats submission. | To understand usage patterns of the Dark Theme feature, so we can more accurately prioritize theme-related bugs. |
| `eventType` | Always set to usage. | Specifies that this data is related to GitHub Desktop usage, so we can filter it correctly in our analytics. |

## Measures
These are general metrics about feature usage and specific feature behaviors. These help us understand our users' mental map of the application, hypothesize pain points within the application, and aid in feature and bugfix planning so that we can improve workflows that are more likely to benefit users.

<!-- The `active` field is marked with an `*` because it's actually a dimension that was defined as a measure. Since it is represented in source that way, it is mimiced in this doc. -->
| Metric | Description | Justification |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `commits` | The number of commits made. | To understand usage patterns of commits made in Desktop. |

| `defaultBranchComparisons` | The number of times a branch is compared to the default branch. | To understand usage patterns around the compare branches feature. |
| `mergesInitiatedFromComparison` | The number of times a merge is initiated in the `compare` sidebar. | To understand usage patterns around the compare branches feature. |
| `updateFromDefaultBranchMenuCount` | The number of times the `Branch -> Update From Default Branch` menu item is used. | To understand usage patterns around the compare branches feature. |
| `mergeIntoCurrentBranchMenuCount` | The number of times the `Branch -> Merge Into Current Branch` menu item is used. | To understand usage patterns around the compare branches feature. |
| `prBranchCheckouts` | The number of times the user checks out a branch using the PR menu. | To understand usage patterns around the PR checkout menu. |
| `repoWithIndicatorClicked` | The numbers of times a repo with indicators is clicked on repo list view. | To understand usage patterns around the repository indicators feature. |
| `repoWithoutIndicatorClicked` | The numbers of times a repo without indicators is clicked on repo list view.  | To understand usage patterns around the repository indicators feature. |
| `divergingBranchBannerDismissal` | The number of times the user dismisses the diverged branch notification. | To understand usage patterns around the notification of diverging from the default branch feature. |

| `divergingBranchBannerInitiatedCompare` | The number of times the user compares from the diverged branch notification compare CTA button. | To understand usage patterns around the notification of diverging from the default branch feature. |
| `divergingBranchBannerInfluencedMerge` | The number of times the user merges from the compare view after getting to that state from the diverged branch notification compare CTA button. | To understand usage patterns around the notification of diverging from the default branch feature. |
| `divergingBranchBannerDisplayed` | The number of times the diverged branch notification is displayed. | To understand usage patterns around the notification of diverging from the default branch feature. |
| `active*` | Flag indicating whether the app has been interacted with during the current reporting window. | To identify users who are actively using Desktop versus those who have it open but never interact with it. |
