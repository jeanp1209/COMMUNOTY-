# Preview Features

If you're running GitHub Desktop you can enable **"preview features"**, which
we consider something we want to eventually ship to everyone, but needs some
sort of refinement before we can do that, and in the meantime we would like
feedback from users on these features.

To opt-in for testing preview features, set the
`GITHUB_DESKTOP_PREVIEW_FEATURES` environment variable to any value and launch
the Desktop app.
