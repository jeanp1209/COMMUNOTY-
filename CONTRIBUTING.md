related projects, which are hosted in the [Desktop Organization](https://github.com/desktop)
on GitHub. These are just guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and
feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

Note that GitHub Desktop is currently a public beta, so everything is likely to
change over time as we learn and refine how we work with the community.

## What should I know before I get started?

### Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.
Please report unacceptable behavior to [opensource+desktop@github.com](mailto:opensource+desktop@github.com).

### The Beta Roadmap

Currently GitHub Desktop is in a public beta, and the team is focused on
triaging reported issues and working towards a 1.0 milestone - where the
application can be used in place of the classic Mac and Windows applications.
You can follow this progress under the [Milestones](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/milestones)
tab.

We're still thinking about where we want to take GitHub Desktop after we reach
this 1.0 milestone. If you have ideas or suggestions please read the [Suggesting Enhancements](#suggesting-enhancements)
section below to understand how to contribute your feedback.

### Help Wanted

As part of building GitHub Desktop, we'll identify tasks that are good for
external contributors to pick up. These tasks:

 - have low impact, or have a known workaround
 - should be addressed
 - have a narrow scope and/or easy reproduction steps
 - can be worked on independent of other tasks

These issues will be labelled as [`help wanted`](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/labels/help%20wanted)
in the repository. If you are interested in contributing to the project, please
comment on the issue to let the core team (and the community) know you are
